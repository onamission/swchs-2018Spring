# swchs-2017
Poker game for SWCHS Coding Club

This is some code that we are using in the SWCHS Coding Club spring semester 2017 to learn about Web Development and the software development process. Some of the code within this project is intentionally not using "Best Practices" to show why best practices are important. Also, this is an unfinished project since time ran out in the semester.

Also of note, we started with a multi-page PHP project and were in the process of refactoring as a single page ES6 Javascript, so some things are a bit out of wack.
